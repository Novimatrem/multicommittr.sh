# multicommittr.sh
The script to save my ability to code. Ensures all code and all code changes ends up automatically in the places they should, as a backup for safety. Those being:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Dropbox

Which then manually gets uploaded every so often to:
- My USB backup hard drive

# how to (win10)

Windows usage of the script is unsupported by me, I don't use Windows. It may work, it probably won't. I don't test it on Windows. See LICENSE for details.

For Windows, the script is only tested on the latest versions of Windows 11 and probably depends on it.

It should require Windows 11 version 23H2 build 22635.4145 or later.

Run the following commands inside of Git Bash in order to download and start the script.

Required dependencies are: Git Bash (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), and Microsoft's modern 'Windows Terminal' (from the Microsoft Store)

```git clone https://github.com/Novimatrem/multicommittr.sh```

```cd multicommittr.sh```

```cmd "/C run-win-LTSC-enterprise.bat"```

# how to (linux)

Linux usage of the script is unsupported by me, I don't have your setup. It may work, it probably will, and I do test it on Linux, but your mileage may vary. See LICENSE for details.

Required dependencies are: Bash, and a Terminal Emulator.
